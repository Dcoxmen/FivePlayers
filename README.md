# MERN Fury Phaser Game and CRUD Profile w JWT Auth and Redux

# Phaser Tank Game with Membership Portal

> MERN Fury is a lightweight turn based game made with the Phaser javascript engine framework for 2D HTML5 browser games. The game is accessible
> through a player membership portal which requires a name, email and password to join.
> Once registered the new user is redirected to the login form that takes them to their player dashboard.
> All of the members features are available from this interface to add/update/delete a profile, list your favorite games, links, skill set, and, access to play MERN Fury.
> Membership profiles are viewable by the public and are not required to be logged in to view.
> Profile portal network was built with the MERN stack technology, JWT authentication, and, Redux.
> Authentication is managed by Passport and JWT Token creation while Redux manages this across states.
> Concurrently was installed to create an easier way to start up both the node.js and react client servers together for faster development.
> Designed database models using MongoDB and Mongoose then user api routes and authentication were built and tested with Postman.
> The Frontend was made with react and bootstrap. React Router and Redux with Reducers were used to manage states and authentication.
> MVC concepts applied.
>
> The game was made with phaser technology utilizing it's built in Arcade physics engine and WebGL with Canvas to create fast rendering. This is
> is all connected and powered from a google firebase database using device orientation sensors to use a smartphone as an optional controller.
> Some challenges in developing the game included resolving land and vehicle destruction issues, controller syncronization and state sequence.

> The game is the main feature of the application and the most challenging to build. After some research and testing we decided to build the game from scratch using the phaser javascript gaming engine utilizing many of it's built in features:

> WEBGL & Canvas

> Arcade Physics Engine

> Full sprite creation and control

> Cameras

> Sound Support

> Tilemaps

=======================================================

> Some of the challenges we faced:

> Land and Vehicle collision detection

> Physics Engine Adjustments

> Multiple device motion sensor control.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

> You will need to create a keys_dev.js in the server config folder with

```
 module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'YOUR_OWN_MONGO_URI',
  secretOrKey: 'YOUR_OWN_SECRET'
};
```

## App Information

> Below demonstrates how :

> This is the information, how [gameState] in firebase works.
> [gameState]
> When you create new game, the game assigns [gameState] to [10].

> 10 : Loading page / No one has been joined)
> 11 : Player 1 joined
> 12 : Player 2 joined (Create 'Game Start' button)
> 13 : Player 3 joined
> 14 : Player 4 joined
> 15 : Player 5 joined (Block joining)

---

> If 'Game Start' is pressed, it create a game for [gameState-10] of players,
> then the game will assign [gameState] to new number

> 0 : Only player 1 can control
> 1 : Only player 2 can control
> 2 : Only player 3 can control
> 3 : Only player 4 can control
> 4 : Only player 5 can control

> 5 : End game / Show a winner
